# 🚀 SmileSchool Landing Page

A fully responsive, mobile-first landing page built to showcase modern web design and front-end development skills. This project replicates a professional, high-fidelity design, focusing on CSS Grid, Flexbox, and semantic HTML structure.

## ✨ Features

This project implements a detailed multi-section layout, including:

  * **Header & Hero Banner:** High-contrast header positioned over a dark-overlay background image to emphasize the main call-to-action.
  * **Best Performers Section:** A **4-column grid** layout showcasing circular profile images, designed to be fully responsive.
  * **Quote Testimonial:** A distinctive, large block quote to highlight customer feedback.
  * **Popular Tutorials:** A responsive card-based layout using **CSS Grid** to display video thumbnails, titles, ratings, and duration.
  * **Membership CTA:** A dark, high-impact Call-to-Action section with a large, centrally aligned registration button.
  * **FAQ Section:** A clean, two-column layout optimized for easy readability.
  * **Footer:** A dark, professional footer with logo, social media links, and a centrally aligned copyright notice.
  * **Mobile-First Design:** Implemented using CSS Media Queries to ensure a flawless experience on all devices, defaulting to single or dual-column layouts on mobile.

## 💻 Technologies Used

  * **HTML5:** For semantic document structure.
  * **CSS3:** For styling, leveraging modern techniques:
      * **Flexbox** for alignment (e.g., Header, Footer, Video Meta).
      * **CSS Grid** for complex multi-column layouts (e.g., Video Grid, Membership Blocks, FAQ).
      * **Media Queries** for a mobile-first approach.
      * **`text-shadow`** for legibility on the Hero Banner.
