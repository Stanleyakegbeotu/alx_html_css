                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I am a passionate software engineering student currently building the foundation of my technical career. I have always been fascinated by how computers work and how lines of code can translate into real-world solutions. My goal is to become a full-stack developer capable of building scalable, user-friendly applications that solve actual problems in my community.

                <h3>The Holberton School Curriculum</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently enrolled in the ALX Software Engineering programme, which is known for its intense, project-based curriculum. Unlike traditional schooling, we focus on peer learning and "doing hard things." Every day presents a new challenge, whether it is managing memory in C programming or understanding complex algorithms. This environment has taught me resilience and the importance of collaboration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The program covers a wide range of topics including low-level programming, high-level languages like Python, DevOps, and System Engineering. We are trained to look under the hood of software, understanding not just <em>how</em> to write code, but <em>why</em> it works the way it does. This deep dive into computer science fundamentals is preparing me for a long-term career in the ever-evolving tech industry.
                </p>

                <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simple Shell:</strong> A custom command-line interpreter built from scratch using C.</li>
                    <li><strong>AirBnB Clone:</strong> A full-stack web application cloning the core features of AirBnB.</li>
                    <li><strong>Binary Trees:</strong> An implementation of binary trees and various traversal algorithms.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These projects have pushed me to think critically and debug systematically. For instance, working on the Simple Shell project required a solid grasp of process creation and memory management. It was a difficult journey, but seeing the shell execute commands successfully was an incredibly rewarding moment that solidified my love for backend development.
